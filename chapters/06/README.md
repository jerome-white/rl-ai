# Notes

## Example 6.2

Applying TD(0) as described in the book is not the way this problem is
done; [this reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1884168)
alludes to the difference.

## Example 6.5

Although the book says alpha is 0.1, the figure can only be reproduced
using a value of 0.5:

```bash
$> python example-6.5.py --alpha 0.5
```
